# Polygamy 

From a book of [Bhakti Vikāsa Swami](http://bvks.com/about/his_holiness/), [**Women: Masters or Mothers?** (3<sup>rd</sup> edition, revised and enlarged)](http://bvks.com/books/mothers_masters/)

As a principle, Śrīla Prabhupāda advocated polygamy (more precisely, polygyny[^1]). 

> Generally in every society the female population is greater in number than the male population. Therefore if it is a principle in the society that all girls should be married, unless polygamy is allowed it will not be possible. If all the girls are not married there is a good chance of adultery, and a society in which adultery is allowed cannot be very peaceful or pure. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society we have restricted illicit sex. The practical difficulty is to find a husband for each and every girl. We are therefore in favor of polygamy, provided, of course, that the husband is able to maintain more than one wife. 
[<sup>CC.1.14.58,purport](http://www.vedabase.com/en/cc/adi/14/58)

> People have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in modern society. The Vedas enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one wife – as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, and vaiśyas, and even sometimes the śūdras – he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society. [<sup>SB.4.26.6,purport](http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/4/26/6)

However, although Śrīla Prabhupāda was overall “in favor of polygamy” [<sup>CC.1.14.58,purport](http://www.vedabase.com/en/cc/adi/14/58), he forbade it within ISKCON for several reasons, including “the possibility of becoming scandalized in the public for breaking their laws in this way; and in future also the devotees who are neophyte may not understand our policy in this connection, and we gradually could wind up attracting only a class of men who are very eager for unlimited sex life only” [^2].

Śrīla Prabhupāda also wrote: “In India … even until fifty years ago, polygamy was freely allowed. Any man, especially of the higher castes – the brāhmaṇas, the vaiśyas, and particularly the kṣatriyas – could marry more than one wife” [<sup>CC.1.14.58,purport](http://www.vedabase.com/en/cc/adi/14/58). However, polygamy is now illegal in India (except for Muslims). 

Although it is generally supposed that women do not like the idea of having to share their husband with co-wives, for some it may be an attractive proposition. For example, if given a choice between having all and observable tendency to “marry upwards,” i.e., to desire a man of higher social status – superior wealth, power, intelligence, physical attractiveness, and so forth. This is evidenced by patronage of modern commercial reproductive clinics, wherein women unfailingly prefer donors who have superior physical and social characteristics. In fact, certain characteristics are in such demand that the clinics will not accept donors who do not possess them. For example, no commercial clinic will accept a donor who is not at least 5' 8" (172 cm) tall, because clients simply will not purchase their semen. Donors who have had psychological problems or other inheritable, physical ailments are also routinely excluded.

Because desirable male attributes are not all “socially constructed,” and therefore can be passed on by means of reproduction, polygamy affords a built-in program of social eugenics. In other words, men of superior nature are given more opportunity to distribute their physical and psychological traits throughout society. In a Kṛṣṇa conscious society, value is placed on characteristics such as self-control and religiousness; so polygamy would facilitate the production of children who have an advantage in their ability for sense control. This is certainly a much better proposition for society than the questionable commercial reproductive clinics[^3].

Polygamy was traditionally well-accepted in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. And even some Christians contest that the insistence on monogamy is not supported by their scriptures; indeed, the Old Testament clearly mentions instances of polygamy. But although polygamy is an ancient and very practical feature of human civilization, due to the influence of Christian morality it has greatly declined throughout the world. 

In Vedic culture, Śrī Rāma is the supreme exemplar of eka-patnī vrata (the vow to have only one wife). Śrī Kṛṣṇa showed another ideal by very kindly marrying 16,100 women, none of whom could otherwise have gotten a husband, for they had already been kept by another man.

According to one of my godbrothers, Śrīla Prabhupāda’s statement that we cannot allow polygamy within ISKCON means that if a man is being maintained by our institution, he should not have more than one wife[^4]. Why should ISKCON, as a religious and charitable institution, financially support such an arrangement? “He may not live off temple funds”[^5]. Śrīla Prabhupāda further stated: “If they want to marry more than one wife, they must live outside our temples in their own arrangements. We have no objection if he does it, but it must be done outside the temple”[^6]. In other words, if a man has sufficient economic capability, if he is not maintained by ISKCON but is generating his livelihood independently, and if he is prepared to maintain and protect more than one wife, then that might be acceptable. However, polygamy is illegal in most Western countries, so for the sake of advancing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission, that illegality alone could be sufficient reason for disallowing polygamy within ISKCON (even if according to the laws of śāstra it should be allowed).

But many young women who come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness via ISKCON do not get a husband. So the reasoning that Śrīla Prabhupāda has given for sanctioning polygamy in general society applies also to this situation in ISKCON. Of course, polygamy is not mandatory for anyone; it is elective.

Hopefully, at some time in the future it will be more viable for devotees to incorporate polygamy within their social policy; and for the sake of guiding society, they will then need comprehensive understanding of this issue[^7].



[^1]: Polygamy is the practice of marrying more than one partner. There are two types of polygamy: polygyny (wherein a man has more than one wife) and polyandry (wherein a woman has more than one husband). In common usage, polygamy generally refers to polygyny.

[^7]: An unintended consequence of the success of the gay marriage movement in the West is that it has become increasingly difficult for the status quo to fend off moral objections and legal challenges from Western proponents of polygamy. Possibly, polygamy in the Western countries may become legal soon and in an unexpected manner.
